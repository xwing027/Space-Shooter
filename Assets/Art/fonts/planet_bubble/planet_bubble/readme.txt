Thank you for downloading a Planet Font!

____________________________________________________________________________

This Planet font is a PC TrueType font. It has a full character set in both 
upper- and lower case, full punctuation, most international characters, 
accents etc. and it contains an extensive kerning table.

All of the typefaces in the planet Font Family are CD-Ware and free for 
non-commercial use. That means, for each typeface you want to license for 
commercial use, you must mail us a CD with something you like: Music you 
have made, sounds you love, strange art or a peculiar piece of software... 
It can be a homebrew CD-R signed with a worn-out purple felt pen or a fancy 
commercial CD. No rules apply, but creativity is always appreciated :-)

Such a CD in our mailbox buys you a personal, non-transferable but 
everlasting license to use that typeface for commercial projects. We 
normally send electronic license confirmations within a couple of days 
after the receipt of a CD in our mailbox. Just remember to include your 
email address with the disc, so we know where to send the confirmation.

If you like what you did with our fonts, you are more than welcome to send a 
copy, a screenshot or a scan of the product back to us. We are always eager 
to see how people use the fonts, and we're collecting examples for future 
publishing on the web.

Kind regards

Mads Rydahl
